## Loading the Hamiltonians

You can load the Hamiltonians stored in `H_data_storage` folder using the code in `load_h.py` file.
The Hamiltonians are currently stored as a `TensorData` object defined in `data_interface.py` file in `H_data_storage` folder.
For efficiency only the non-zero terms are stored in `TensorData` objects.
